# Study of Physical and Natural Adversarial Examples in Computer Vision for Self-Driving Cars

The idea of this project is to train a standard Deep Neural Network for Traffic Sign Classification, followed by a graphic engine to autnomously generate perturbed images which are practically likely to be produced in physical world (eg: mud-slaps, bullet holes, etc.) or images which were captured under natural adversities (eg: rain, lightning, harsh sunlight, etc.).

The main code of the repository is managed in 'Code' folder - currently updated to DNN implementation (VGG-Net).

The dataset used is GTSRB Dataset (https://sid.erda.dk/public/archives/daaeac0d7ce1152aea9b61d9f1e19370/published-archive.html).
